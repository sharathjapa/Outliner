			<p align="justify">Viruses are small obligate intracellular parasites, which by definition contain either a RNA or DNA genome surrounded 
						by a protective, virus-coded protein coat. Viruses may be viewed as mobile genetic elements, most probably of cellular origin and 
						characterized by a long co-evolution of virus and host. For propagation viruses depend on specialized host cells supplying the complex 
						metabolic and biosynthetic machinery of eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. A complete virus particle is called a virion. The main 
						function of the virion is to deliver its DNA or RNA genome into the host cell so that the genome can be expressed (transcribed and 
						translated) by the host cell. The viral genome, often with associated basic proteins, is packaged inside a symmetric protein capsid. 
						The nucleic acid-associated protein, called nucleoprotein, together with the genome, forms the nucleocapsid. In enveloped viruses, 
						the nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid bilayer derived from the modified host cell membrane and studded with an outer layer of 
						virus envelope glycoproteins.
