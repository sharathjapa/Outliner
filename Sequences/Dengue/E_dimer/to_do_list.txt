The file dengue_Edimer_aligned.fasta contains sequences of dengue virus' Envelope protein which exists as a dimer. 

Description of file:
Use text viewer to open this file.
The line starting with '>' is called a header (or name of the sequence).
The following lines untill there is another '>' is called the sequence. eg.: MRCI... WFKK
To know more about the file format, refer this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format
If you carefully notice, there are 124 headers with their corresponding sequences.

To get a better sense of the file in a matrix form, it can also be visualized graphically:
Install ClustalW/X from http://www.clustal.org/clustal2/
Open the file and you will notice that sequences are displayed in a matrix form. 
Again, each row represents a sequence, whereas each column represents a position number in the sequences. 
Try to think of it as a matrix to develop own analysis / visualization programs. Most of the visualization analysis will be performed on the column data.
