BioInformatics Visualization Project
The biological context of this project will be mapping mutations of viruses. The problem is computationally simple...Think of a virus as a string of characters (DNA). Different regions of this string have different functional roles and each position on this string has 
differe mutation rates. A virus mutates under evolutionary pressure for infection and it becomes difficult to keep a track of mutations for each position in the string. The idea is to come with a visualization of a mutation database to present everything in a visually appealing and more informative way. A streamlined storage and visualization of such data will help biologists to develop better vaccines.
